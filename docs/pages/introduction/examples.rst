Since the dVRK is the sum of parts assembled based on each site's
hardware and research applications, all the kits are set up
differently.  This section shows a few illustrative examples.

   .. tab:: Original Kit

      dVRK Classic original kit at Johns Hopkins. Intuitive provided
      the PSMs, MTMs, HRSV, foot pedals and endoscope. Frame and head
      sensor are custom. Arms are controlled using the dVRK controllers
      and software.

   .. tab:: da Vinci Classic

      Full da Vinci Classic at Johns Hopkins. This is a full system,
      previously used with the Intuitive controllers. All arms, SUJ,
      foot pedals, head sensor, height adjustment and videos are
      using the dVRK controllers and software stack. HRSV has been
      upgraded with flat panels.

   .. tab:: Si cart and Classic MTMs

      Si patient cart with Classic MTMs at Johns Hopkins.  This is a
      full system previously used with the Intuitive controllers.  All
      arms, SUJ, foot pedals, height adjustment and videos are
      controlled by the dVRK controllers and software stack.  The HRSV
      is replaced by an HMD (:ref:`Goovis <goovis>`).
