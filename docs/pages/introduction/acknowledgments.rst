The `cisst software <https://www.cisst.org>`_ has been developed with
the support of the National Science Foundation, EEC 9731748, EEC
0646678, and MRI 0722943.

The da Vinci Research Kit was supported by the National Science
Foundation, via the National Robotics Initiative (NRI), as part of the
collaborative research project "Software Framework for Research in
Semi-Autonomous Teleoperation" between The Johns Hopkins University
(IIS 1637789, 2016-2020), Worcester Polytechnic Institute (IIS
1637759, 2016-2021), and the University of Washington (IIS 1637444,
2016-2020).

The `dVRK Consortium <https://dvrk.lcsr.jhu.edu/dvrk-consortium>`_,
based at JHU, has been organized by members of the dVRK community to
provide technical support.

The `National Science Foundation <https://www.nsf.org>`_ is supporting
a network of networks, including the dVRK network, via the AccelNet
program, as part of the collaborative project "International
Collaboration to Accelerate Research in Robotic Surgery" led by The
Johns Hopkins University (OISE 1927354, 2019-2024) and Worcester
Polytechnic Institute (OISE 1927275, 2019-2024).

Starting with Version 2.0.0, the dVRK software has also been supported
by the Multi-Scale Medical Robotics Center (MRC), InnoHK, Hong Kong,
China.
