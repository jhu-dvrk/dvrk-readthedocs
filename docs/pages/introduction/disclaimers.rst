.. warning::

   The dVRK is **not FDA approved**. It should in no circumstances be
   used on patients.

.. warning::

   The dVRK comes with **no warranty whatsoever**.

.. warning::

   The dVRK is **not a turnkey system**. The clinical da Vinci is very
   easy to use as soon as it is delivered.  On the other hand, the
   dVRK requires some software, mechanical and robotic knowledge to
   operate!

.. warning::

   **dVRK â‰  daVinci**.  Do not equate the dVRK to the da Vinci.  These
   two systems share the same mechanical parts but the electronics and
   software are different.  Therefore, a defect or flaw identified
   using a dVRK system should not be used to infer that the da Vinci
   clinical system is defective or flawed.
