.. warning::

   The dVRK is **not FDA approved**. It should in no circumstances be
   used on patients.

.. warning::

   The dVRK comes with **no warranty whatsoever**.

.. warning::

   **Assembly required**, the dVRK is not a turnkey system. The
   clinical da Vinci comes fully configured and is user-friendly.  On
   the other hand, the dVRK takes time to configure and requires some
   software, mechanical and robotic knowledge to operate!

.. warning::

   **dVRK â‰  da Vinci**.  Do not equate the dVRK to the da Vinci.  These
   two systems share the same mechanical parts but the electronics and
   software are different.  Therefore, a defect or flaw identified
   using a dVRK system should not be used to infer that the da Vinci
   clinical system is defective or flawed.
