Disclaimers
***********

* The dVRK is not FDA approved. It should in no circumstances be used
  on patients.

* The dVRK doesn't come with any warranty whatsoever.

* The dVRK is not the da Vinci.  These two systems share the same
  mechanical parts but the electronics and software are different.
  Therefore, a defect or flaw identified using a dVRK system should
  not be used to infer that the da Vinci is defective or flawed.

* The dVRK is not a turn-key system. The clinical da Vinci is very
  easy to use as soon as it is delivered.  On the other hand, dVRK
  requires some software, mechanical and robotic knowledge to operate!
