How to get a dVRK?
******************

There are three main sources for the :ref:`first part of the kit
<from_ISI>`, i.e., retired parts of da Vinci systems:

* The vast majority of dVRK groups received their hardware through the
  `Intuitive Foundation
  <https://www.intuitive-foundation.org/dvrk/>`_.
* Some groups also salvaged a retired da Vinci directly from a hospital
  (often affiliated to their university). If you have any ongoing
  collaboration with a hospital with a da Vinci system, it is worth
  asking them what they plan to do with it when it will be
  retired. Note that all the instruments and other disposable parts are also
  very useful so it's worth saving as much as possible.
* Finally, it is possible to find full da Vinci systems or da Vinci
  parts at a reasonable price on auctions sites such as eBay.

The second part of the kit is the :ref:`dVRK controllers <from_JHU>`.
If you reached out to the Intuitive Foundation for the mechanical
systems, they will help you figure out how to acquire the
controllers. Otherwise, you can reach out to the dVRK developers.
Alternatively, since the design is open source, you can manufacture
your own controllers.  This is, by far, a much more difficult approach
but we know of at least one group that went that way (:ref:`#21
<groups>`).

:ref:`Everything else <from_user>`, computers, cables, display,
mounts... can be bought on the internet.  All the mechatronics
designs, firmware, software and documentation are hosted on public
repositories on GitHub.
