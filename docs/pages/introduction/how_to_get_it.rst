How to get a dVRK?
******************

There are three main source for the :ref:`first part of the kit
<from_ISI>`, i.e. retired parts of da Vinci systems:

* The vast majority of dVRK groups received their hardware through the
  `Intuitive Foundation
  <https://www.intuitive-foundation.org/dvrk/>`_.
* Some groups also salvaged retired da Vinci directly from an
  hospital, often affiliated to a university.  If you have any ongoing
  collaboration with an hospital with a da Vinci system, it's worth
  asking them what they plan to do with it when it's retired.
* Finally, it is possible to find full da Vinci or da Vinci parts at a
  reasonable price on auctions sites such as eBay.

The second part of the kit is the :ref:`dVRK controllers <from_JHU>`.
If you reached out to the Intuitive Foundation, they will help you
figure out how to acquire the controllers.  Alternatively, since the
design are open source, you can manufacture your own controllers.
This is, by far, a much more difficult approach.

:ref:`Everything else <from_user>` can be bought on the internet of
retrieved from GitHub.
