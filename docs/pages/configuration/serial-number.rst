*****************
Arm serial number
*****************

Each arm is uniquely identified by it's serial number, also known as
tracking Id (TRK ID).  It's important to find the serial number and
use it consistently across configuration files.

.. caution::
   Do not modify serial numbers in configuration files (content and
   name) unless you really know what you're doing.

   Do not copy/rename a file with a serial number in its name to
   create a configuration file for another arm.
   
   Serious damage can occur!

To find the serial number, look for a label on the arm itself.
