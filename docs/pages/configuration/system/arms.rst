Arms
****

`Documention based on schema <../../../schemas/dvrk-system.html#arms>`_ is
also available for reference (including examples).

List of arms declared in the system.  Most arms are "native",
i.e. classes used to interface with the Intuitive arms with a dVRK
controller. One can also add a derived or generic arm (see development
options).
