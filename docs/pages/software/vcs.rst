Repositories
************

For ROS users, we recommend to use ``vcs`` to retrieve all the
repositories used by the dVRK software stack.  ``vcs`` allows users to
manage a set of repositories.  The source of all packages based on the
*cisst*/*SAW* libraries can be downloaded using ``vcs``.  Generic
compilation instructions and vcs files can be found on GitHub:
https://github.com/jhu-saw/vcs.

The sections below include the ``vcs`` command lines specific to the
dVRK.

All the code for the dVRK is compatible with ROS1 and ROS2.
