Repositories
************

For ROS users, we recommend to use ``vcs`` to retrieve all the
repositories used by the dVRK software stack.  ``vcs`` allows users to
manage a set of repositories.  The source of all packages based on the
*cisst*/*SAW* libraries can be downloaded using ``vcs``.  Generic
compilation instructions and vcs files can be found on GitHub:
https://github.com/jhu-saw/vcs.

The following sections include the ``vcs`` command lines specific to
the dVRK for both ROS 1 and ROS 2.

All the code for the dVRK is compatible with ROS 1 and ROS 2.

.. note::
   The main repository for the dVRK software stack is
   |sawIntuitiveResearchKit|_.  This follows the naming convention used for
   all cisst/SAW components, i.e. ``<manufacturer><product>``. This is
   quite a long name and the acronym is not great: IRK. Hence the
   name dVRK.
