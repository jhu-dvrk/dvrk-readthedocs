Arm
===

The da Vinci Si systems came with either 2 or 3 PSMs.  PSM1, PSM2
and PSM3 are identical.

   da Vinci Si PSM

Basic information:

* The arm is attached to the :ref:`SUJ <suj_si>` using 4 long bolts
  and slides.
* The arm can be tilted forward
* 7 motorized degrees of freedom, 7 actuators with optical encoders
* All motors are located in the first 2 links and use cable transmission
* All actuators have digital potentiometers, used for both homing and
  safety checks
* 3 electric brakes on the first 3 joints to prevent the arm from
  falling when not powered (like the :ref:`ECM Classic <ecm>`).
* The second actuator controls a set of belts used to enforce a RCM
  point (remote center-of-motion, aka fulcrum point).  `Google search
  <https://www.google.com/search?q=surgical+robot+center+of+motion+fulcrum+point>`_.
* The full arm is composed of two parts, the arm's base (not
  sterilized) and a removable instrument (sterilized and disposable).
  This design is very similar to the :ref:`PSM Classic <psm>`.

Cannula and sterile adapter
===========================

The design of the last 4 joints and instrument on the Si system is
very similar to the :ref:`PSM Classic <psm>` so please refer to that
section.  The parts are a different so we provide some pictures below.

There is also video at the end of this section describing the process.

   da Vinci Si PSM with sterile adapter (without drape)

One difference between the PSM Classic and Si is that the cannula holder on the Si is not removable.  The sterile drape comes with a piece of soft molded plastic that fits between the cannula holder and the cannula.

The cannula holder comes taped to the drape (second opening) and must
be securely attached to the arm by turning the locking mechanism a
quarter turn.

The cannula is reusable and sterilizable.  Cannulas come in different
diameters, 5mm, 8mm... to match the diameter of the shaft of the
instrument used.  Since we don't often use the real sterile drape,
there is a small gap between the cannula holder and the cannula.  To
prevent mechanical, one can use masking tape as a "shim".

The cannula is held by the cannula holder (shocking) and secured using two flaps.
