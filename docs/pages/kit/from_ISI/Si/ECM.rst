Arm

The da Vinci Si systems came with one ECM.

   da Vinci Si ECM

   Basic information:

* The arm is attached to the :ref:`SUJ <suj-si>` using 4 long bolts
  and grooves (same at :ref:`PSM Si <psm-si>`)
* The arm can be tilted forward (on Si SUJ; 70 degrees)
* 4 motorized degrees of freedom, 4 actuators with optical encoders
* The first two motors are located in the first 2 links.  The last two
  motors, insertion and roll along endoscope axis, are located in the
  insertion base link. The translation mechanism uses a lead screw.
  transmission
* All actuators have digital potentiometers, used for both homing and
  safety checks
* 3 electric brakes on the first 3 joints to prevent the arm from
  falling when not powered (like the :ref:`ECM Classic <ecm>` and
  :ref:`PSM Si <psm-si>`)
* The second actuator controls a set of belts used to enforce a RCM
  point using complementary angles (remote center-of-motion, aka
  fulcrum point).  `Google search
  <https://www.google.com/search?q=surgical+robot+center+of+motion+fulcrum+point>`_.
* The full kinematic chain is composed of two parts, the arm's base
  with all the actuation (not sterilized) and a removable endoscope
  (sterilized)

Cannula and sterile adapter
===========================

This part is very similar to the da Vinci Classic so please read the
section related to the :ref:`ECM Classic <ecm-adapter>`.
