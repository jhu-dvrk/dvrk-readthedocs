History
=======

The first generation da Vinci, also known as Standard or Classic, was
developped in the late 90s.  Intuitive uses the name "Standard" by
contrast to the second generation which came with a HD :ref:`video
pipeline <video-sources>`.  Since "Standard" is not very descriptive,
we started to call the first generation system "Classic".  The da Vinci Classic was maintained until 2012.

.. note::

   The da Vinci S used a very similar surgeon's console so the MTMs
   from a da Vinci S are still called MTM Classic.  The same applies
   to the head sensor, foot pedals...
