Arm
===

The da Vinci Classic systems came with one ECM.

   da Vinci Classic ECM

Basic information:

* The arm is attached to the :ref:`SUJ <suj>` using 4 bolts.
  The mounting surface is tilted 45 degrees forward
* 4 motorized degrees of freedom, 4 actuators with optical encoders
* The ECM is under-actuated
* 3 electric brakes on the first 3 joints to prevent the arm from
  falling when not powered
* All actuators have analog potentiometers, used for both homing and
  safety checks
* The second actuator controls a mechanical parallelogram used to
  enforce a RCM point (remote center-of-motion, aka fulcrum point).

* The full kinematic chain is composed of two parts, the arm's base
  with all the actuation (not sterilized) and a removable endoscope
  (sterilized)
* There are three different types of endoscopes (straight, 30 degrees
  down or up)

Cannula and sterile adapter
===========================

Since the endoscpe is removable and there is a barrier (sterile
drape) between the sterile and non-sterile area, there are 2
distinctive points where the instrument is in contact with the arm.
The instrument is attached to the base arm at the top of the insertion
stage and guided along the cannula (trocar) at the bottom of the
insertion stage.

There is a video at the end of this section describing the process.

When prepared for surgery, a sterile drape covers the whole arm.  The
drape has an opening for the sterile adapter. The sterile adapter
comes taped to the drape.

At the bottom of the insertion stage, a cannula is attached to the arm
via a cannula holder.  The cannula is long enough to guide the
endoscope through the RCM point, i.e. the point of entry in the
patient.

The cannula holder is sterilizable and is attached to the base of the
insertion stage using a fixed pin.  To remove the cannula holder,
there is a small button on the back of the insertion stage.

The cannula is reusable and sterilizable.  If you don't have a
cannula, you can use a piece of paper as a shim so you can lock the
latch.

The cannula is held by the cannula holder (shocking) and secured using
a latch.  Once the adapter and cannula are in place, one can insert
the endoscope in the adapter.
