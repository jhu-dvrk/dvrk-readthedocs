Controller versions
*******************

The board versions and description of changes for each build can be
found in the release notes for:

* FPGA: https://github.com/jhu-cisst/FPGA1394#release-notes
* QLA: https://github.com/jhu-cisst/QLA#release-notes
* dRAC: https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/drac#drac

Some hardware
[modifications](/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki/Controller-Boxes#hardware-modifications)
might be required as we're adding new features and discovering issues
with older builds.

A list of sites for each build can be found in the
[timeline](/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki/Timeline).

The FPGA and QLA serial number (S/N) have the form ``BBBB-xx`` or
``BBBB-xxx``, where ``BBBB`` denotes the build number (see table
below) and ``xx`` or ``xxx`` is the board number, starting with ``01``
or ``001``. For example, the first FPGA and QLA built have S/N
``3116-01`` and ``3174-01``, respectively. The S/N is physically
labeled on each board (white sticker) and can be programmed into the
board EEPROM, which is accessible via software. Since Build 4, the S/N
has been programmed during manufacturing. For older builds, the S/N
can be programmed using the ``pgm1394`` utility.

All controllers come with FireWire adapters.  Ethernet adapters were
introduced on FPGA 2+, i.e. in build #5 (2016).
