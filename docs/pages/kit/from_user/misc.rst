HMD (for example :ref:`Goovis<goovis>`).

FireWire cables
***************

Some cables should be shipped with the controllers. If you need more
cables, maybe longer cables, we **strongly** recommend UniBrain cables
(FireWire-400 A to A, 6 pins to 6 pins). See UniBrain
https://www.unibrain.com/products/firewire-400-cables/.  Using random
FireWire cables found in your lab or on the web is a sure way to lose
a fair amount of time debugging connection issues.

Foot pedal extension cable
**************************

If you need to use the original foot pedals of the da Vinci Classic
(or S) surgeon, you need to buy a DB15 extension cable (for example
https://smile.amazon.com/Monoprice-6ft-DB15-Molded-Cable/dp/B002LWJ7TA).
See also foot pedals :ref:`hardware <pedals>` and :ref:`software
<config-pedals-original>`.
