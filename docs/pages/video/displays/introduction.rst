Introduction

On the clinical da Vinci systems, the surgeon's console has:

* A stereo display called HRSV (for High Resolution Stereo Video).
  These are large and heavy aluminum frames with two monitors (CRTs)
  and mirrors for each eye.  Some early dVRK sites received the bare
  HRSV by itself, usually the Classic SD version.  Later on, Intuitive
  has provided the full surgeon's console from S systems.  These come
  with higher resolution HRSV and a head sensor.
* A head sensor able to detect if the operator is present or not
  (their head is against the stereo display or not).  By default, the
  system will not allow teleoperation if the user is not looking at
  the video.

For the dVRK community, there are a few things to know to use or
upgrade the existing HRSV and :ref:`head sensor <head>`.  There are
also some alternative options such as HMDs with head sensor (see
:ref:`Goovis <goovis>`).
