HRSV with flat panels
#####################

Some groups have replaced the CRTs in the HRSV provided by ISI with a
pair of LCD panels.  The main issue is to find the proper size of
monitor, i.e. roughly 14" with 4/3 ratio and ideally a fairly high
resolution.

* 2021: UBC used a pair of 14" monitor for CCTV from eyoyo:
  https://www.amazon.com/Eyoyo-Monitor-1024x768-Security-Speakers/dp/B08L9BC16X.
  Resolution is 1024x768.
* 2018: CUHK used a pair of DELL monitors (1505FP:
  https://www.amazon.com/Dell-1505FP-15-IN-LCD-MONITOR/dp/B0026JQ85Y).
  Resolution is 1024x768.
* 2016: JHU found some replacement parts for old laptops and LCD
  controllers that work fine (see ISI Research Wiki:

  **[Password protected]**).  Unfortunately, some of these parts are
  getting harder to find online.  Resolution was up to 1400x1050.
