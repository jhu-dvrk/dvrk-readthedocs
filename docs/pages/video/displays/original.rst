The da Vinci Classic came with two SD CRT (Cathodic Ray Tube)
monitors, their resolution is 640x480.  The connectors on the back of
the monitor is not totally standard and each group will have to build
a custom cable to provide a VGA interface.  One can find instructions

The da Vinci S consoles came with two higher resolution CRTs
(1024x768).  These monitors have a standard VGA input and you don't
need any special adapter.
