The dVRK community is fairly heterogeneous, each site has different
needs and hardware available.  The goal of this page is to list the
different options and solutions used on different sites.

We start by introducing the different endoscopic cameras Intuitive has
been able to donate to the dVRK community over time.  There are
roughly 3 types of cameras, The oldest one is know as Classic SD
(640x480), the second group is known as S HD (same endoscope and focus
controller but 1080i sensors) and finally the Si HD (not sharing any
part with Classic SD and S HD).

We then describe some solutions for the 3D displays and how to send
the video from the patient side to the surgeon's side (both pure
hardware and hardware + software based pipelines).
