Overview

The dVRK community is fairly heterogeneous, each site has different
needs and hardware available.  The goal of this page is to list the
different options and solutions used on different sites.

We start by introducing the different endoscopic cameras Intuitive has
been able to donate to the dVRK community over time.  We then describe
some solutions for the 3D displays and how to send the video from the
patient side to the surgeon's side (both pure hardware and hardware +
software based pipelines).
