Hardware based pipeline
***********************

The hardware based pipeline is the simplest solution and likely the
cheapest.  It is based on off-the-shelf converters that can be placed
between the CCUs and the monitors.  The main drawback is that one can
not modify nor process the videos coming from the CCUs before
displaying on the HRSV monitors.

   Hardware based video pipeline

You will need some standard cables as well as a pair of video
converters (one for the left video and one for the right video):

 * S-Video to VGA: Paddsun US New for Video Converter CGA/EGA/YUV/RGB TO VGA board
 * SDI to VGA: Wiistar 3G-SDI to VGA Video Converter Box
