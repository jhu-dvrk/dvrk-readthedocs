ECM
***

.. note::

   You can skip this section if you have a full patient's cart since
   the ECM is mounted on the SUJ.

On a clinical system the ECM is mounted on a plate tilted 45 degrees.
It is recommended to use the same mounting angle if you don't have the
setup joints and need to build your own frame.

To position the ECM correctly, please read the :ref:`PSM Classic mount
section <psm-ecm-position>`.
