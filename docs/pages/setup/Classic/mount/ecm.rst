ECM
***

.. note::

   You can skip this section if you have a full patient's cart since
   the ECM is mounted on the SUJ.

On a clinical system the :ref:`ECM <ecm>` is mounted on a plate tilted
forward at a 45-degree angle.  It is recommended to use the same
mounting angle if you don't have the setup joints and need to build
your own frame.

To position the ECM correctly, please read the :ref:`PSM Classic mount
section <psm-ecm-position>`.
