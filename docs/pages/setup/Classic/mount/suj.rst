SUJ
***

Mount
=====

The dVRK SUJ controller should be mounted on the back of the vertical
column of the patient cart.  The enclosure comes with 4 holes that
should match existing screw holes on the column.  You should:

* Remove the existing plate
* Leave the 4 thin grey cables untouched (these are for the
  potentiometers measuring the up/down translations for the SUJ)
* Use spacers between the column and the dVRK SUJ controller to
  prevent crushing the cables
* Connect the SUJ connectors.  There should be enough space below the
  controller to run the SUJ-PSM1 and SUJ-ECM cables under it.

Connections
===========

Don't use the very long cables that were originally used between the
patient's cart and the surgeon's console, connect the SUJs directly to
the dVRK SUJ controller!  When everything is connected, all the
connectors at the base of the patient cart should be unused.

We recommand to stack all the dVRK arm controllers in a cart right
behind the patient's cart.  The cables from the arm should be long
enough to reach said cart.  The cables from the SUJs are not extremely
long but they should reach the back of dVRK SUJ controller.
