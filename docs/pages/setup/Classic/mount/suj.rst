SUJ
***

The :ref:`dVRK SUJ controller <controllers-suj-classic>` should be
mounted on the back of the vertical column of the patient cart.  The
enclosure comes with 4 holes that should match existing screw holes on
the column.  You should:

* Remove the existing plate
* Leave the 4 thin gray cables untouched (these are for the
  potentiometers measuring the up/down translations for the SUJ)
* Use spacers between the column and the dVRK SUJ controller to
  prevent crushing the cables
* Connect the SUJ connectors.  There should be enough space below the
  controller to run the SUJ-PSM1 and SUJ-ECM cables under it.
