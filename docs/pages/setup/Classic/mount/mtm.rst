MTMs
****

Newer dVRK groups should have received an original surgeon's console,
either S or Si with HD monitors.  This section is for groups that
either didn't receive the original surgeon's console or want to
replace it.

For further examples of mounting frames for the PSMs, check the
`Intuitive Research Wiki <https://research.intusurg.com/>`_ (account
required).

The following pictures show an alternative surgeon's console built at
Johns Hopkins.  It holds two MTMs and their dVRK controllers (top
shelf) as well as an :ref:`Si CCU <camera-si>` and light source
(bottom shelf).  The dimensions are based on an Si console (spacing
between MTMs, width...) and the console is narrow enough to go
through most doors.

The MTMs come with a steel bracket and 4 mounting holes.  This bracket
is mated to an aluminum plate mounted on the 80-20 frame.

The top shelf is braced using standard size 45 degree 40mm profiles
from 80-20.

The HMD (:ref:`Goovis <goovis>`) is mounted to the console using a
small Noga arm.

The base and vertical post is made of 40x80mm profiles.  We used a
standard 80-20 bracket to support the front casters.  The arm rest can
slide up and down (Allen wrench required).  All the controllers and
video equipment are connected to a single power strip for
convenience.
