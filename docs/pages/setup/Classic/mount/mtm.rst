MTMs
****

Overview
--------

Newer dVRK groups should have received an original surgeon's console,
either S or Si with HD monitors.  This section is for groups that
either didn't receive the original surgeon's console or want to
replace it.

For further examples of mounting frames for the :ref:`MTMs <mtm>`,
check the `Intuitive Research Wiki <https://research.intusurg.com/>`_
(account required).

.. note::
   The cables coming from the MTMs are fairly short, make sure you
   can place the dVRK controllers really close to your surgeon's
   console.

The following pictures show an alternative surgeon's console built at
Johns Hopkins.  It holds two MTMs and their dVRK controllers (top
shelf) as well as a :ref:`Si CCU <camera-si>` and light source
(bottom shelf).  The dimensions are based on a Si console (spacing
between MTMs, width...) and the console is narrow enough to go
through most doors.

   <goovis>`

The MTMs come with a steel bracket and 4 mounting holes.  This bracket
is mated to an aluminum plate mounted on the 8020 frame.

The top shelf is braced using standard size 45-degree 40 mm profiles
from 8020.

The HMD (:ref:`Goovis <goovis>`) is mounted to the console using a
small Noga arm.

   Custom surgeon's console, mount for HMD

The base and vertical post is made of 40 by 80 mm profiles.  We used a
standard 8020 bracket to support the front casters.  The arm rest can
slide up and down (Allen wrench required).  All the controllers and
video equipment are connected to a single power strip for
convenience.

Resources
---------

The initial frame at Johns Hopkins was built using a fair amount of
spare parts found in the lab.  If you plan to build a cart from
scratch, we recommend to use the design provided by Hao Yang from
Vanderbilt University.
