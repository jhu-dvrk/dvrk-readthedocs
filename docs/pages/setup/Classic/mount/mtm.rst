Connections
===========	   

The only thing to connect is the large cable with an ITT Cannon 156
connector that comes from the arm.

When connecting to the dVRK controller, make sure you don't force the
connector in, the connector should insert without any forces (ZIF -
Zero Insertion Force) The direction varies between arms, cable coming
out either on the left or right.

Once the connector is inserted, you need to use a large flat head
screw driver to secure the it in place.  The screw on the back shell
is connected to a camshaft to lock the connector to the controller.
You need to turn by 90 degrees at most (a quarter turn).  If you need
to remove the connector, don't forget to unscrew it first.

.. warning::

   Failure to lock/screw the arm connector will lead to bad contacts
   and will prevent the arm from working correctly.
