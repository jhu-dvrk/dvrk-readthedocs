PSMs
****

.. note::

   You can skip this section if you have a full patient's cart since
   the PSMs are mounted on the SUJ.

The da Vinci Classic PSMs are fairly easy to mount.  There are 4 holes
at the base of the PSM black bar.  The four holes form a 2" square (2
inches ~= 5.1 cm).  If you want to mount the PSM in a rigid manner,
you can simply drill and thread 4 holes in an 80-20 standard plate.

For the a clinical system, the PSMs are mounted on the passive setup
joints (SUJ).  These passive arms allow the user to position each
arm's RCM point at the entry point in the patient.  The RCM point is
physically located near the large black band on the cannulas.  Ideally
all the arm's RCM points (PSMs and ECMs) should be located on the
"surface" of the patient.

The PSMs are designed for minimally invasive surgeries and their
workspace is fairly limited.  Therefore it is very important to
position them optimally to avoid hitting the physical joint limits.
Ideally, when in zero position (i.e. each joint in the middle of their
range), the instrument's shaft should be aligned to the normal on the
"surface" of the patient.  To simply, one can consider that the
patient is a sphere and the entry points are placed are placed at
different azimuth and altitude.

To allow all the base frames orientations, one can use a ball head
mount for each PSM.  Some groups used a Really Right Stuff BH-55 Ball
Head.
