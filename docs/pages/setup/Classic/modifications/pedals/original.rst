Orginal da Vinci foot pedals
============================

Description
-----------

The original da Vinci foot pedal tray has 5 pedals.  From left to
right: CLUTCH, CAMERA, Focus +/-, GOAG and BI-COAG.  The pedals CLUTCH
and CAMERA are used to clutch the MTMs and switch to-from PSM vs ECM
teleoperation.  The Focus +/- is used to control the endoscope focus
(there is a custom cable for the dVRK) and cauterization (mono-polar
and bi-polar).  For the dVRK, we tend to use the COAG pedal as a
dead-man switch in lieu of the head sensor.

Connection to dVRK controller
-----------------------------

The foot pedal connection can be found on the front of the master
console.  Removing the tray from the console is a bit tricky.  You
will first need to unplug the cable from both the foot pedal and the
console.  On the console side, the connector is hidden under the
plastic cover under the stereo display.  This plastic cover is holding
with clips, so you just have to pull it away.

Unplug the bottom part and connect it to the dVRK controller.  This
cable is rather short, so one might consider investing in an extension
cable
(e.g. https://smile.amazon.com/Monoprice-6ft-DB15-Molded-Cable/dp/B002LWJ7TA).

Removing the foot pedal tray
----------------------------

If you're keeping the surgeon's console and display, you can leave the
foot pedals as-is.  But if you plan to build your own mounting frame,
you will need to remove the cable from the surgeon's console.  The
cable passes through the base and is a bit hard to remove.  First,
open the cable management bar to free the cable (black articulated
arm).  Remove the screw at the pivot point, flip the bar upside-down
and remove the small Philips screws.  At that point, you can remove
the black round grommet from the base, so you can push the round
connector inside the base.  The grommet is glued, so you'll need to pry
it out using a flat head screw-driver.  Make sure you don't damage the
cable.

The next step is to remove the metal cover placed under the console.
There is a cavity under the base, but it has a cover holding with 4
9/64 hex screws.  You will need to reach out under the console and
find the four screws by touch. There is just enough space between the
floor and the bottom to use a small Allen wrench. Removing these 4
screws is the trickiest part of the process.

Once the cover plate is removed, push the round connector in the round
opening, push the rectangular connector in the rectangular opening, and
you'll be able to pull the cable from under.
