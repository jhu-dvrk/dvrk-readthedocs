Introduction
============

The dVRK usually comes with a set of foot pedals.  If you have a full
da Vinci Classic surgeon console, you will need to disconnect the foot
pedals and use a standard extension cable.

This section also presents alternative foot pedals that can be used
the dVRK controllers and software.  There are multiple cases where one
might need some extra foot pedals:

* Splitting your system into two systems, e.g. using the MTMR and PSM1
  for one setup and the MTML and PSM2 for another setup.
* Using extra inputs from a patient's side assistant.
* Using the dVRK software without any dVRK controller.  For example,
  using a Force Dimension haptic device on the surgeon's side and the
  patient cart in simulation.

We present two different options that are supported with the dVRK
controllers and/or software:

* Foot pedals that connect to the dVRK controllers
* USB foot pedals with joystick emulation
