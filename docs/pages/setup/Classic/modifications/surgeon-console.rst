Surgeon console
***************

The surgeon consoles currently available to the dVRK community are either
Classic (aka Standard) or S. They look very similar, i.e. they both use CRT
monitors and the electronics are place behind the stereo display. Since the
electronic components are useless for the dVRK, it is possible to remove it
and use the freed space to set up the dVRK MTM controllers.

There are some instructions re. gutting the surgeon's console on the Intuitive
Research WiKi: https://research.intusurg.com/index.php/DVRK:Documentation:Main,
"S Console Disassembly and Vision Testing for the dVRK" (**password

Once the back of the surgeon's console is gutted, you can install the dVRK MTM
controllers.

For all dVRK groups with the full surgeon console (as opposed to just MTMs), it
is recommended to look at the :ref:`head sensor <head-original>` and
:ref:`stereo display height <height>`.
