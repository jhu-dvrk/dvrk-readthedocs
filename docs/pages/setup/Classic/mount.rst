Mount
#####

If you have a full surgeon's console, you can skip the MTMs subsection re.
mounting MTM arms. You might want to clean the back of your Classic/S surgeon's
console to mount the MTMs dVRK controllers (see :ref:`surgeon console
modifications <modifications-surgeon-console>`).

If you also have the full patient's cart, go to the SUJ section and skip the
PSMs and ECM section.

Finally, if you have the original dVRK kit, you can skip the SUJ
section.
